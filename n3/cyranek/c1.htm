      Virtual environments are getting more and more popular: We are talking
      about virtual libraries, virtual schools, virtual universities, and
      virtual laboratories (IITAP &amp; UNESCO 1999) to broaden access to
      knowledge and skills as far as connectivity is available. In combination
      with traditional face-to-face classroom based teaching and learning,
      virtual environments become efficient means in translating the principle
      of the right to access to knowledge into reality. ICT can now offer
      effective and efficient learning environments for primary and secondary
      education, vocational training, universities, continuous education, but
      also for literacy training.<o:p>

      When considering the underlying infrastructure for virtual learning, we
      have to keep in mind that there are substantial differences among
      geographical regions and countries in the availability and in the capacity
      of network services. Examples for research and development on appropriate
      use of advanced IT for virtual learning environments are the information
      highway initiative and the related higher education and school programmes
      in the USA, programmes of the European Commission, the Francophone Virtual
      University or the African Virtual University of the World Bank. Specific
      educational technology standards are needed to ensure re-usability of
      contents, methods and tools, interoperability of services, quality,
      multi-linguality, harmonized curriculum, accreditation etc. Educational
      systems and other public service organizations will have to work closely
      with industrial concerns to develop standards which are flexible, open,
      freely available, and meet the needs of both industrialized and developing
      countries. The international community, including UNESCO, has a special
      role in promoting and guiding this process (Hunya &amp; Rose 1998).<o:p>

      In basic education, the main challenges of the information society include
      providing tools for students to share ideas, to learn in collaborative
      environments, and to become literate in the information technologies which
      will be part of the future work places and lives. Lifelong and non-formal
      learning will be increasingly pursued by a large number of people in the
      information-based society. The labour market and changing working
      conditions will necessitate more re-training. The availability of
      non-traditional learning materials will encourage those who prefer the
      edutainment style. Crucial issues are intelligent course design,
      adaptability of use, high quality, accessibility and affordability.<o:p>

      In industrialized countries the development of virtual universities is
      very promising, a booming area (EU 1998). The Open University of Catalunya
      was established as a virtual campus from the beginning. The Spanish
      national open university UNED with over 150,000 students, has made
      significant progress in using ICT. The german distance education
      university Fern-Universität Hagen offers courses on its WWW-based virtual
      campus. In Switzerland the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swiss
      Virtual Campus</i> is getting reality (Levrat 1997). Other examples for
      virtual approaches in the USA are the World Lecture Hall of the Houston
      University, the Maryland Virtual High School Project, the Virtual
      Washington University Project, or the University of Central Florida.<o:p>

      Out of 53 African countries 43 are now participating in the Regional

      as part of the Intergovernmental Informatics Programme (IIP) of UNESCO.
      RINAF is particularly concerned with strengthening the roles of the public
      sector and the civil society in Africa in exploiting information and
      communication technologies for development. In the coming years we have to
      strengthen RINAF networking for the inclusion of all societal sectors
      including rural, isolated and other disadvantaged communities. During the
      RINAF meeting in Addis Ababa October 1999 as part of the African
      Development Forum (<a href="http://www.uneca.org/adf1999" target="_blank">www.uneca.org/adf1999</a>)
      ten priority projects were identified: </span><span lang="DE">1 Linking

      analysis was elaborated at the RINAF workshop in Cape Town, May 2000, with
      the elected project coordinators. The RINAF workshop in Maputo, November
      2000, will finalize the proposals of the identified priority projects.<o:p>

      UNESCO supports strongly the installation of African digital libraries (Quéau
      &amp; Rose 1998). However, the advances to network libraries were
      concentrated in university-based libraries, and therefore school and
      public libraries have been largely excluded. African libraries have to
      strengthen their efforts to become gateways to information highways for
      development, by making textbooks and periodicals electronically available,
      as well as audiovisual materials and computer-based courseware. All
      appropriate technologies should be applied to bring needed information to
      the community level, including CD-ROM and inexpensive local reprographic
      facilities.<o:p>

      The potential of virtual learning environment has to be understood by
      decision makers in the educational and vocational sector. To support and
      evaluate virtual learning environments for distance education is now the
      task. First hands-on experiences in the field are necessary with Internet
      browsing for relevant materials, E-mail for communication with teachers
      and professors, CD-ROM access for documents and interactive simulations.
      In addition, the access to virtual libraries will improve educational
      institutions with state-of-the-art didactical and methodological materials,
      access to international scientific journals and conference documentation.
      Just as important as electronic access are print-outs at free or minimal
      charge for educational and public service use. The implementation of
      Virtual Laboratories (IITAO &amp; UNESCO 1999) and the production of
      CD-ROMs with examples of good practice are one way to support educational
      institutions, using simulation tools, groupware and other new software
      techniques as appropriate. Nevertheless, this approach has to be supported
      by affordable delivery channels which means that public service sector
      users have to consolidate their needs in negotiations with
      telecommunication and Internet service providers, and that the public
      authorities have to assume a proactive, constructive role in promoting the
      installation of <i>information infrastructure</i> in schools, communities
      and other public service sector institutions.<o:p>

      In addition to affordable information infrastructure and IT applications
      based on African needs, for building information communities in Africa
      requires appropriate political, legal and ethical frameworks ensuring the
      development of a dynamic electronic public domain and affordable access to
      information facilities by all sectors of society including professional
      and grass roots communities. These are part of the wider domain &quot;info-ethical&quot;
      considerations which are a key part of the UNESCO concerns (see

      The most promising Internet applications in education are virtual
      libraries, lesson–experience environments and course-support
      environments (Collis 1998). The private library made from collections of
      resources of virtual libraries becomes the bookmark collection of one’s
      browser. These virtual materials are available on the basis of interest,
      rather than location restrictions and cost. The lesson–experience
      approach is attractive for linked creative educational projects e.g. on
      water pollution or second language courses. More and more course-support
      environments are experienced all over the world at University level and as
      seminars for business people. This virtual campus approach is a
      fashionable word for organizing the institutional process in education,
      but has to be developed in a stronger regional and local manner for
      cooperation and exchange of educational knowledge. We need more experience
      to develop the medium in new directions. The expression <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Virtual
      University</i> offers different approaches how to benefit from and how to
      use this interactive medium for access to resource persons, documents and
      virtual libraries, videoconferencing, chatrooms etc. Unfortunately, the
      access to educational services is more and more seen as electronic
      commerce (IMS-Project 1997).<o:p>

      </b>One criteria to look at the concept of virtual university is: How do
      different virtual learning environments support regional cooperation
      within the existing educational institutional context? Generally spoken,
      for all these approaches is very important: for a better understanding and
      the development of local Internet didactics (Harris 1998, Winnips 1998)
      there is a strong need for courses to traditional professors at the
      collaborating universities about self–learning, cooperation, autonomy
      and self-organizing of the learning process and about what the options are
      for designing virtual learning environments<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>(Ramos &amp; Fagundes 1998).<o:p>

      Very important is the type of evaluation process looking very clearly to
      learn from the use, possible misuse, advantages and disappointments in

      During a visit to South Africa’s largest distance education university
      UNISA attempts were discussed to go on-line. It was indicated that
      UNISA’s education system still depends on postal services. Experiences
      from the States have shown that on-line courses are very difficult to
      manage when targeting a large number of students as it is the case with
      UNISA. Benefiting from new technology, UNISA which offers courses cheaper
      than most open or distance universities, is spreading its wings across the
      world. Experiments, especially in co-operation with Canada are now under
      way to have technical courses on-line accessible.<o:p>

      are developed in Canada, the USA and Europe. The videotapes and live
      lectures are broadcasted from uplinking facilities in the USA via INTELSAT.
      A digital library program offers access to 1700 scientific journals for

      The concept of the African Virtual University (AVU) is a
      interactive-instructional telecommunications network established to serve
      the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The mission of AVU is to use
      the power of modern information technologies to increase access to
      educational resources throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of the
      AVU is to build world-class degree programs that support economic
      development by educating and training world-class scientists, technicians,
      engineers, business managers, health care providers, and other
      professionals. As AVU is a project of the World Bank, the central
      scheduling for broadcasting courses is headquartered in Washington, DC.<o:p>

      AVU undergraduate program course package consists of videotaped and live
      lectures supplemented by class notes, textbook and homework. The
      videotapes and live lectures are broadcasted from COMSAT RSI uplinking
      facilities in Clarksburg Maryland. Live sessions are originated in Ku band
      from US universities on GE Spacenet 3 and INTELSAT 603 for the Irish
      courses to COMSAT earth station which re-transmits the signal to Africa on
      INTELSAT 515 in C band frequency. The typical satellite receive terminal
      at an AVU partner institution in Africa consists of a 4.5 meter antenna,
      coaxial cabling to the classroom, and a totally redundant receive system
      in the classroom, i.e. VCR, PC to control the system, high speed data
      interface, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD), facsimile, printer and
      UPS for dish antenna and classroom equipment. The AVU sites work with VSAT
      (Very Small Aperture Terminal) to direct satellite link. VSAT technology
      offers communication for Telephon, Fax, E-Mail and Internet with at least
      64 Kbps. Costs for the terminal and dish antenna are 20-25,000 US$. The
      costs p.a. for satellite access for Virtual Learning and Videoconferencing

      Sustainability of the AVU after the pilot phase will be ensured from
      students tuition and revenues from seminars. The virtual seminars at
      Kenyatta University in Nairobi are financially a success. As a background,
      the educational situation in Kenya is alarming: Annually 160.000 students
      are leaving secondary school. But in 1999 only 9.000 students had access
      to the country’s universities. That means 151.000 have no adequate
      perspective as alternatives to the University diploma are more or less
      missing like vocational training institutions, polytechnics, etc.
      Therefore AVU is a chance to get a course degree e.g. in Information
      Technology: Operating systems, Webdesign, Network Management, etc. 2 weeks
      cost 50$ covering 2 hours/day; a 2 month course with 8 hours/day costs
      200US$, a 9 month pre-university course costs 1200 US$. It is very popular
      and fashionable to demonstrate for example a MIT course certificate,
      independent of the course content. In addition executive seminars are
      offered for 40$/day. The services like Fax service, e-mail (1$/page)
      digital library (2,5 $/month) are used by students, faculty members,
      workers, housewifes from town. AVU at Kenyatta University Nairobi with
      this fee structure makes 80,000 US$ profit/year. This amount will be
      reinvested for infrastructure, buildings, PCs, etc. In a next step, the
      cooperation between universities in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda will be
      strengthened for local course development which then will be broadcasted
      through the World Bank satellites network.<o:p>

      The offered degree program is depending on the demands of provinces, e.g.
      in municipal engineering, law, accounting etc. Also short term courses are
      offered for local needs. A two-week course for the public costs 80 US$/participant
      (salary in Ethiopia 60 US$/month, but other statistics say that 60% of the
      population have a daily income of 1 US$ or even less). As an evening
      program an accounting diploma is offered. A master degree program runs in
      urban management. From all 14 regions in Ethiopia 1800 regular students
      are at ECSC. A Centre for Distance Learning will be established with
      centres in each region (starting in 2000 with 6 regions). In the beginning
      the courses are offered only on paper. Similar satellite stations like in
      Addis Ababa are planned in 2000 for regional centres within these six
      Ethiopian provinces. In the near future the ECSC has to make its own
      profit to expand and spread courses in the country. <o:p>

      local universities? How to adapt existing course material? Can
      Universities or teacher training institution in Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea
      Bissau, Mozambique, São Tome e Principe offer courses or material for
      distance education? What type of training for local professors to reach a
      better understanding of didactical methodologies, of tools for
      co-operation, etc? What can be done at each institution to integrate
      distance courses in local curriculum? Which institutions in Brazil and
      Portugal are willing to offer courses? What are actually experiences in
