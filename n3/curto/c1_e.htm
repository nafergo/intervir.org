      When I was chosen to open a Competence Centre in Information and
      Communication Technology in São Tomé and Principe (STP), I knew nothing
      consistent about this country. The vague information I had coincided in
      one point: it was a country with great structural problems and a low level
      of education and qualification.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>

      Still in Portugal I had a pleasant surprise: this country had an online
      daily journal, “Tela Non” (<a href="http://www.cstome.net/diario/index.htm">http://www.cstome.net/diario/index.htm</a>)
      which I became a frequent reader of and it allowed myself to get
      acquainted with some of its political, economic and social aspects. To
      obtain more information I had to resort to Internet search but the
      information I got was generally very poor. It was easy for me to conclude
      that this was an area to be developed in the project context. <o:p>

      The search for published material about STP was very difficult since I
      only found a book on STP in one bookshop, from the three best-furnished
      bookshops of Lisbon. <o:p>

      Financed by the Portuguese Ministry of Education through the European
      Affairs and International Relations Office (GAERI) and with the support of
      Programa Nónio, the Competence Centre resulted from a protocol between
      Portugal and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, and
      signed by the respective prime ministers in 1999. This Centre is included
      in a broader set of measures, concerning the support to the Educational

      Installed in the Higher Polytechnic Institute, the only university
      teaching unit in the country, its teachers and students are the priority
      public in the development of training courses in ICT. In the 2<sup>nd</sup>
      semester of 2001 the Centre carried out two short duration courses for the
      teaching staff (planned according to a survey to estimate their needs),
      and weekly training throughout the semester for all 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
      term (final term) classes, included in the curricular planning.<o:p>

      In the academic year 2001/2002, the training courses carried out by this
      Centre are covering 70 students (87,5%) of 1<sup>st</sup> term, 19
      students (50%) 2<sup>nd</sup> term and 10 students (100%) 3<sup>rd</sup>
      term. Thus, the Centre is responsible for the training in ICT of 99
      students, which represents 76% of the total students in the institute (excluding
      0 term students who are not included in this type of training). In each
      semester one more training level is launched, to widen, in a growing and
      comprehensive way, the competence of students in ICT, and whose level will
      stabilize in the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester of 2003/2004 for final students,
      in a total of 6 semesters of ICT training. <o:p>

      Out of the training timetable, the room also functions as a Resources
      Centre, open to the community, favouring the educative community. It is
      provided an informal training here, through a permanent support to the
      users who, for the most part, have very limited or practically null
      knowledge of informatics. This support is made through the action of two
      part-time co-workers, selected by internal contest in HPI, and who help
      keep the Resources Centre open from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 and from 2:30 to
      7:30 p.m.<o:p>

      With occupation rates of 100%, the Centre has more than 1200 users (the
      user card began in June 2001), mostly belonging to the educative community,
      necessarily with more than 7<sup>th</sup> term education level. Between
      June and October 2001 more than 3,600 users frequented the Centre. This
      huge turnout imposed a computer usage period of 45 minutes.<o:p>

      Moreover, other training courses have been developed, namely the one hold
      during the “I Biology Teachers National Meeting”, where this Centre
      actively participated and supported the Portuguese co-operant teachers,
      mainly in editing and reproducing teaching materials. Owing to the severe
      deficiencies existing in this country, both in technical and in human
      terms, the Centre also assists people and institutions, national and
      foreign, preferably connected to education and culture, like the <i>Instituto
      Diocesano de Formação</i> (the only school with similar pedagogical
      level to Portugal), the Portuguese School, Camões Institute and the
      Portuguese Language Centre, among others. <o:p>

      The inclusion of the HPI in the telematic network of the Portuguese
      Language Universities (whose meeting took place in Alcobaça, Portugal, in
      April 2001, and had the presence of two HPI members) is being carried out

      The HomePage, edited by the Centre in June 2001, has a generalist
      information on São Tomé and Principe, supported by a great number of
      texts and figures, displaying more than 150 photos about several aspects
      of STP physical and human landscape, both in the present and in the past.
      It also means to be a vehicle for the spreading of aspects related with
      education in special, and intends to be in the future a starting point for
      exchange activities between STP schools and schools from the Portuguese

      As a country of limited physical and human resources, frequently misused,
      the obstacles for the implementation of this kind of projects are varied.
      Without intending to be exhaustive, I refer some of these conditionings:<o:p>

      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Educational
      and technological panorama</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">.
      São Tomé and Principe faces severe and chronic problems in education.
      Among other causes, I must stress the insufficiency or inadequacy of the
      existing infrastructures, the lack of motivation and insufficient specific
      training of the teaching staff, the lack of manuals and other didactic
      material, the unsuitability and incoherence between the legally adopted
      educative system and the real one, the low level of education and the high
      number of students in the classes. To these factors we can also add the
      high level of school dropout, the reduced opportunities for
      techno-professional training and a generalized regression of the education
      related figures.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In contrast with this situation, I must stress the High Polytechnic
      Institute (<a href="http://www.stome.net/">www.stome.net</a>) oriented to <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">teachers’
      initial training</span> at bachelor’s degree, and whose first students
      finished their course in 2000/2001.<o:p>

      With this situation in the educational area, in the technological area,
      with a very reduced number of computers and a great lack of human
      resources, the needs are huge. And out of the capital town, where these
      means are concentrated, the rest of the country can be considered
      practically as a desert in informatics terms. <o:p>

      Although STP is considered as one of the African countries with better
      telecommunications network, its network is analogical and even the few
      existing digital lines, are strangled with the connections with foreign
      countries in the local ISP. This makes it impossible, for instance, to use
      the videoconferencing devices in <span style="background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; mso-highlight: aqua; background-position: 0%">distance

      commercialisation. (the record of CDs ruined in a simple playback was 7,

      the ignorance about STP implies a more extended period of time. I can’t
      help telling a case, which can sound like a joke, though the inconvenience
      it caused: I had a UPS for all the computers and suddenly, one day, it had
      a breakdown. As it was within the guarantee and the cause was a fault, the

      the UPS digital board. In spite of the importer calls and faxes, the part
      was delaying. A month after, this importer, at his own expenses, decided
      to import the board directly from the representative in Portugal, being
      the problem solved in two weeks. When the part arrived from the factory in
      Denmark, we looked at the address on the parcel and understood the reason
      of that strange delay:<o:p>

      </span></b>In a positive perspective, we must stress the great interest
      and motivation for the Information and Communication Technologies,
      expressed by the younger generations and the competences revealed by some
      of them. But they miss the conditions for the development and
      implementation of this knowledge and allow others to acquire the necessary
      competences in this area. This is one of the aims of the Competence
      Centre.</font></span></p>

      Though the opportunities of training in this area are scarce, I should put
      in evidence the activity of a Centre of Competence supported by FCTI,
      through the program “InforJovem” and the activity of two private
      companies, one of them responsible for the only “Cybercafé” in STP,
      opened in the last season of 2001.<o:p>

      I must also refer the busy newsgroup about STP, a meeting place of ideas
      and reflections, at </font></span><font size="3"><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/saotome"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font face="Arial">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/saotome</font></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font face="Arial"><o:p>

      All this represents a set of small evolutions that may mean an advance in
      the acquisition of the competences for the use of ICT and their
      implementation. <o:p>

      The entrance of this country in the oil producers club was very important,
      because it will help to eliminate some of the present conditionings. I
      only hope that STP will remain an exception to the rule in what is
      happening among the Gulf countries. Let us wait and see…<o:p>

      To conclude, I believe that the use of Information and Communication
      Technologies, together with the elimination of some relative distances
      they create, will be an important contribute to make São Tomé and
      Principe closer to Europe and less far from Africa.<o:p>
