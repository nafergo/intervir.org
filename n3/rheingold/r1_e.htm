      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geographic
      information systems (GIS) are visible maps that are combined with computer
      databases. The elements of the map, from streetcorners in urban systems to
      creekbeds in wilderness surveys, serve as windows into the database. Click
      on the streetcorner and see the income level of the neighborhood, or where
      telecommunications networks are distributed. Click on the creekbed and
      look at the underground resources, or see how the surrounding forest
      looked ten years ago, a hundred years ago.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS can be used as
      a political weapon as well as a scientific tool. GIS proved to be a potent
      political instrument in Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign strategy: Databases
      combined voting patterns with precinct maps and literally made visible to
      campaign planners the concentrations of &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; who
      were crucial to Clinton's strategy. By knowing where to concentrate
      resources, the Clinton team gained a strategic advantage. Another
      political use of GIS is to uncover &quot;redlining,&quot; illegal
      exclusion of specific racial groups by realtors in certain areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it makes
      patterns and trends visible in a map form, instead of representing them
      abstractly as numbers and graphs, GIS can be either an exploratory tool
      like a microscope, or a tool for advocacy, like a printing press.
      Political activists can amplify their influence by showing decision makers
      what they are talking about. Eric and Steve Beckwitt of the Sierran
      Biodiversity Institute helped convince the U.S Congress to preserve some
      old-growth forests in Californiaby using GIS to demonstrate how big the
      forest used to be, and how little is left. And a Portland, Oregon-based
      group, Ecotrust, successfully teamed up with GIS specialists to convince
      the government of British Columbia to protect the remaining remnants of
      North America's rainforest from logging.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Erin
      Kellogg, Ecotrust's director of policy and communications, &quot;&quot;Kitlope
      Valley in British Columbia is part of the surviving remnant of this
      continent's temperate rainforest. We gathered information about temperate
      rainforests from a wide variety of sources and published a report
      illustrated with GIS maps. The map-illustrated data proved to be a key
      element in our political strategy.''</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, the
      objective of GIS is to stimulate insight in the mind of an expert --.the
      power to understand the way a watershed evolves, or the relationship
      between geographic features and the presence of petroleum, for example.
      Sometimes, the objective of GIS is to stimulate insight in the mind of a
      voter or decision-maker. In either kind of use, GIS helps people think
      about issues that otherwise would be too abstract to grasp easily.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing cities,
      for example, is a complex task that is getting more complicated every day.
      The problem is not necessarily a lack of information, but a lack of a way
      to make the available information easily accessible and understandable.
      Huge amounts of information exist about environmental changes, urban
      planning, resource use, transportation patterns, demographic shifts, but
      the sheer size and complexity of this mass of data makes it impossible to
      use the information to plan and manage. By using a map as the interface to
      the data, and a computer database to match points on the map to relevant
      data, it becomes possible to not only track and update, but to visualize
      data patterns at various scales. Look at a map on a computer screen, click
      on a point that interests you, ask for data, and you know how many people
      have moved into an old neighborhood, or the location of toxic wastes
      within a city, or the areas of maximum traffic at rush hour. Now, with the
      advent of the Worldwide Web, it is possible to turn GIS systems into
      websites, and give entire populations access to this sophisticated tool.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harvard's <a href="http://icg.harvard.edu/~maps/maatlas.htm" target="_blank">&quot;Massachusetts
      Electronic Atlas&quot;</a> makes maps and data available for queries and
      searches regarding the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The atlas is a joint
      project of Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Geography Department of the
      University of Massachusetts -- Boston, and the Harvard Map Collection.
      Anyone with Internet access can view a map of the Commonwealth, choose an
      area within that state, zoom or pan the map, query and view data about
      &quot;communication, economy, education, employment, environmental
      regulation, health, income, physical features, population, race, real
      estate/lodging, transportaion, and political boundaries for cities and
      towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. With the 1990 Census aging and
      widely available, the atlas focuses on alternative and more recent sources
      of demographic, business, and environmental information collected from
      numerous databases in the public domain. In the future, we plan to add
      additional federal, state, local, and commercial information, including
      historical maps of various regions.&quot; People who use the Massachusetts
      Electronic Atlas can use up to 15 different search filters at once, and
      can download maps and associated data.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIT's <a href="http://ortho.mit.edu/nsdi/" target="_blank">Digital
      Orthophoto Browser</a> makes available searchable aerial photos of the
      Boston area, linked with key data. Each cell on the map is 4 kilometers (about
      2.5 miles) square, representing an 8,000 by 8,000 pixel digital orthophoso
      image. By choosing settings and clicking on the map displayed on the web
      page, people can zoom, pan, and download photos. They can enter search
      terms for neighboroods, ZIP codes, and principal features.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Together
      Foundation and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements sponsors <a href="http://www.bestpractices.org/" target="_blank">a
      site that lists six hundred projects from ninety five countries</a> that
      offer successful approaches to managing urban and rural environments and
      improving access to quality housing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Green Maps published at <a href="http://www.greenmap.com" target="_blank">http://www.greenmap.com</a>
      offer GIS thumbnail views of environmental sustainability resources in
      Copenhagen, Denmark, Athens, Georgia, Montreal, and Gouda and Utrecht in
      Netherlands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My source for GIS
      information and up to date information about environment and technology is

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unexpected
      collision of two unrelated technologies sometimes creates an altogether
      new technology with properties of its own. Put a television screen
      together with a typewriter keyboard and a microprocessor, and you get a
      personal computer. Combine computers and telecommunication networks and
      you get the Internet. Maps are an ancient communication device, computers
      are more recent. In combination, these two tools have spawned something
      new and powerful, and therefore worth keeping an eye on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS, especially
      when it is available through the Web, makes it possible for people to
      envision, understand, and plan. But a tool is only a tool. It takes people
      with vision and purpose, working together, to make things happen.
      Increasingly, technology furnishes the tools we can use to help make our
      cities and our planet work in a more humane and sustainable manner. But
      whether these tools can build better tomorrows is up to the people who use
      them.</font></p>
