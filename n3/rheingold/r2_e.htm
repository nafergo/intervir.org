      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil society, a web of informal relationships that exist independently
      of government institutions or business organizations, is the social
      adhesive necessary to hold divergent communities of interest together into
      democratic societies. <a href="http://epn.org/prospect/24/24putn.html">The
      future of civil society in America and elsewhere is uncertain, even gloomy.</a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can virtual communities help revitalize civil
      society or are online debates nothing more than distracting simulations of
      authentic discourse? Enthusiasts like myself point at examples of
      many-to-many communication that appear to leverage power in the real world
      of politics. But how certain can we be, sitting at our desks, tapping on
      our keyboards, about the reality and limits of the Net's political
      effectiveness? Would you bet your liberty on it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If citizens lose our freedom to communicate
      without fear of state censorship, then the Net's potential power to
      facilitate &quot;electronic democracy&quot; will stand revealed as a fatal
      illusion. Because the rights of citizens to communicate online are under
      direct political attack, Net activists are broadcasting action alerts,
      directing citizens' attention to the implications of proposed legislation,
      furnishing contact information for key legislators on crucial votes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even if freedom of expression was not
      under attack, it's healthy to ask ourselves whether the kind of discourse
      facilitated by computer bulletin board systems will bring together or
      further fragment the competing constituencies of the American republic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil society that Alexis de Tocqueville
      noted two hundred years ago in &quot;Democracy in America&quot; as the
      hallmark of the American experiment - the active involvement of citizens
      in voluntary associations for &quot;the public good&quot; - appears to be
      deteriorating.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Net really an effective answer to the
      mass hypnosis of the mass media era? Talking at each other online seems to
      be at least marginally better than sitting stupified in front of the tube,
      but we need to know how far, exactly, all that talk can carry us. Will
      worldwide Usenet discussions, up-to-the-minute legislative news listervers
      and WWW pages, e-mail chain-letter petitions add to civic life, or remove
      people from it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best critique of the democratic potential
      of virtual communities I've found so far is &quot;Computer-Mediated
      Communication and the American Collectivity:The Dimensions of Community
      Within Cyberspace,&quot; by Jan Fernback and Brad Thompson, a paper
      presented to the 1995 meeting of the International Communication
      Association This paper inspired me to sharpen my own critical perceptions
      regarding virtual communities. <a href="http://www.rheingold.com/texts/techpolitix/VCcivil.html">An
      abridged version is available</a>, with the permission of the authors, on
      my website.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernback and Thompson cite past outbreaks of
      technological utopianism to question the claim that online communications
      can strengthen civil society:&quot;Citizenship via cyberspace has not
      proven to be the panacea for the problems of democratic representation
      within American society; although communities of interest have been formed
      and strengthened...and have demonstrated a sense of solidarity, they have
      nevertheless contributed to the fragmented cultural and political
      landscape of the United States...&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors cite several arguments against
      believing in the democratizing power of virtual communities: the
      disjunction with geographically based neighborhoods can create phony
      communities, the cost of the technology and knowledge of how to use
      computers will always exclude much of society, virtual communities are
      helping make direct face to face conversation less common, among other
      arguments. Their conclusions are bleak: &quot;... it seems most likely
      that the virtual public sphere brought about by [computer mediated
      communication] will serve a cathartic role, allowing the public to feel
      involved rather than to advance actual participation.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the conclusion of this paper is wrong. I
      think there is time to prove the democratic potential of the medium by
      using it properly. Electronic communications do not offer a utopia, but
      they do offer a unique channel for publishing and communicating, and the
      power to publish and communicate is fundamental to democracy.
      Communication media are necessary but not sufficient for self-governance
      and healthy societies. The important stuff still requires turning off the
      computer and braving the uncertainties of the offline world. When we are
      called to action through the virtual community, we need to keep in mind
      how much depends on whether we simply &quot;feel involved&quot; or whether
      we take the steps to actually participate in the lives of our neighbors,
      and the civic life of our communities...</font></p>
