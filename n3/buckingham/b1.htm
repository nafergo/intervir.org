      Almost twenty years ago, following an international meeting of experts
      held in Grunwald in Germany, UNESCO published a declaration making the
      argument for media education. The Grunwald Declaration (contained in the
      appendix to this paper) offers a succinct and powerful rationale that is
      of enduring relevance. It argues that the media are an increasingly
      significant and powerful force in contemporary societies; and that a
      coherent and systematic form of education about the mass media must be
      seen as an essential component – indeed, a prerequisite – of modern
      citizenship. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In its definition of media education, the Grunwald Declaration reflects
      several key emphases that continue to be shared by the majority of media
      educators today:<o:p>

      Over the past twenty years, several interrelated changes – some of them
      foreseen in the Grunwald declaration itself - have made the argument for
      media education even more urgent. The media have increasingly penetrated
      all areas of social life: it is now impossible to understand the
      operations of the political process or of the economy, or to address
      questions about cultural and personal identity – or indeed about
      education – without taking account of the role of the media. Among the
      most significant changes are the following:<o:p>

        dominate the marketplace; yet new technologies also permit more
        decentralised, localised communications, and the creation of
        ‘communities’ that transcend national boundaries. Meanwhile, the gap
        between rich and poor – both within and between nations – appears to
        be widening; and this is also manifested in terms of access to

      However we interpret them, these developments are decidedly double-edged.
      They create new inequalities even as they abolish older ones. They appear
      to offer new choices for individuals even as they appear to foreclose and
      deny others. Either way, they make the nature of contemporary citizenship
      – the issue that is at the heart of the Grunwald declaration –
      significantly more complex and ambiguous. <o:p>

      The modern media are centrally implicated in all of these processes; and
      this has particular implications for children and young people. For the
      global media industries, the young are the key consumers, whose tastes and
      preferences are frequently seen to set the trend for consumers in general.
      The formation and development of ‘youth culture’ – and, more
      recently, of a global ‘children’s culture’ – are impossible to
      separate from the commercial operations of the modern media. Both in
      research and in public debate, children are frequently seen to be most
      vulnerable to media influence; yet they are also seen to possess a
      confidence and expertise in their relations with media that are not
      available to the majority of adults. They are defined both as innocents in
      need of protection, and as a competent, ‘media-wise’ generation. Yet
      whichever view we adopt, the fact remains that adults are less and less
      able to control children’s access to the media. Whether we look to
      technological devices or to changes in regulatory policy, the means of
      control appear increasingly ineffective. The proliferation of media
      technology, combined with the changing social status of children, mean
      that children can no longer be confined in the traditional ‘secret
      garden’ of childhood – if indeed they ever could. <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      These patterns of technological and structural change in the contemporary
      media environment – and the emergence of what some have called ‘The
      Third Media Age’ – thus present significant new dangers and
      opportunities for young people. Digital media – and particularly the
      internet – significantly increase the potential for active participation;
      but they also create an environment of bewildering choices, not all of
      which can be seen as harmless. In this new situation, we are in urgent
      need of well-informed and sustained educational initiatives. We need to
      enable children to cope with the challenges posed by this new mediated
      environment; and we need to build upon and extend the new styles of
      learning and the new forms of cultural expression that the modern media
      make available to them. Only in this way will it be possible for today’s
      children to take their place as active citizens in the complex,
      commercially-oriented, global societies which are now emerging.<o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ultimately, therefore, media education needs to be recognised as a
      fundamental human right. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
      offers some important indications here. Article 13, for example, asserts
      children’s right to freedom of expression; Article 17 proclaims their
      rights of access to a range of media and sources of information; while
      Article 31 identifies broader rights to leisure and to participation in
      cultural life. If children are to enjoy the rights proclaimed by this
      Convention – and hence to informed participation in the processes that
      govern their lives – media education must be seen as a fundamental
      entitlement for all.<o:p>

      The Progress of Media Education<o:p>

      In the two decades since the Grunwald Declaration, media education has
      been the focus of increasing interest and activity in many countries. Many
      governments have published policy statements and curriculum documents in
      the field; and there have been several international conferences, at which
      delegates from a growing number of countries have been present. UNESCO
      itself has supported several of these initiatives, including the 1990
      conference on ‘New Directions in Media Education’ (Toulouse, France)
      and the recent meeting of experts in Vienna, Austria (Spring 2000). It has
      also supported the development of a network of researchers on children and
      media, with conferences in Paris (1997) and Sydney (2000); and the work of
      the International Clearinghouse on Children and Violence on the Screen,
      which has counted media education as one of its concerns. Significant
      efforts have been made throughout these initiatives to develop North/South
      dialogue, and to involve participants from less wealthy countries.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Nevertheless, the overall picture of development has been uneven, not to
      say incoherent. There is a great diversity in terms of the aims and
      methods of media education, the participants who are involved in it, and
      the contexts in which it takes place. The growth of international dialogue
      in the field has undoubtedly been of great value; but it is not always
      clear that everybody is talking about the same thing. <o:p>

      </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">Thus, media education
      can take place in a range of institutional settings, both ‘formal’ and
      ‘informal’; and it can be provided by bodies from both public and
      private sectors (or combinations of the two). While the primary focus of
      interest in this paper is education for children and young people <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      should not) always be distinguished from educational initiatives aimed at
      adults. Thus, the range of parties and institutions involved in media

      These groups are clearly likely to have diverse motivations, ranging from
      commercial promotion to ‘counter-propaganda’. Some may see media
      education primarily as a matter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">protection</i>

        if opportunities present themselves – it can also bring about change
        much more quickly than is possible in a decentralised system. Likewise,
        some systems allow a greater degree of autonomy to individual teachers
        than others; although even in situations of greater autonomy, factors
        such as the age profile of the teaching profession and the possibility
        of access to further training significantly affect the potential for
        change. In some countries also, there may be greater opportunities for
        change within out-of-school contexts, such as youth and community work;

      Ongoing changes in each of these areas often result in highly uneven
      patterns of educational reform. Thus, many countries have seen instances
      of significant curriculum development projects in media education –
      often with substantial funding and high-level political support – that
      have not ultimately been sustained. More experienced practitioners often
      complain that such initiatives are ‘re-inventing the wheel’,
      suggesting that little has been learnt from the successes and failures of
      the past. Here, as in many other areas, schools themselves can remain
      strikingly resistant to change. Historians of educational reform
      frequently remark that, at least in most industrialised countries, the
      fundamental institutional ‘grammar’ of state schooling has changed
      relatively little since it began in the nineteenth century. Introducing
      new media technology – let alone the kinds of ‘critical thinking’
      and the new pedagogies associated with media education – is almost bound
      to meet with considerable inertia, if not overt resistance. Meanwhile,
      developments in out-of-school settings are frequently short-term and
      piecemeal, reflecting the ever-changing political priorities that seem to
      inform funding policies in this area. <o:p>

      Educational policy-makers frequently argue (as they have been doing for
      decades) that the school curriculum is ‘overcrowded’, and that media
      education is less urgent than other new initiatives in fields such as
      citizenship and information technology. In response, advocates of media
      education assert that many of these ‘new’ areas are intimately related
      to media education; and that media education should be seen as a key
      dimension of a whole range of existing curriculum subjects. Yet the
      broader argument for redefining the curriculum – for precisely the kind
      of ‘integrated approach’ called for in the Grunwald Declaration –
      seems to require an effort of imagination that few policy-makers are
      currently prepared to make. In this context, the implementation of media
      education is likely to require broad-based alliances of participants, both
      within and beyond formal education, and both nationally and

      Despite this uneven and sometimes unsatisfactory record of progress, it is
      possible to detect a broad historical shift in the underlying philosophy
      of media education – even if this shift is not always reflected in
      practice. Historically, media education has often begun as a defensive
      enterprise: its aim is to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">protect</i>
      children against what are seen to be the dangers of the media. The
      emphasis here is on exposing the false messages and values the media are
      seen to purvey, and thereby encouraging students to reject or move beyond
      them. As it has evolved, however, media education has tended to move
      towards a more empowering approach. The aim here is to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">prepare</i>
      children to understand and to participate actively in the media culture
      that surrounds them. The emphasis is on critical understanding and
      analysis, and (increasingly) upon media production by students themselves.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In essence, the protectionist approach seeks to arm students against the
      perceived dangers of the media. To be sure, these ‘dangers’ have been
      defined in different ways at different times and in different contexts. In
      some countries, the fundamental concern of early media educators was a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cultural</i>
      one – that the media represented a form of ‘low culture’ that would
      undermine children’s appreciation of the values and virtues of ‘high
      culture’. In others, the fundamental concern appears to be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">moral</i>
      – that the media will teach children values and behaviours (for example,
      to do with sex and violence) that are deemed to be inappropriate or
      harmful. Finally – and especially in the forms of media education that
      developed in the 1970s – one can detect a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">political</i>
      concern: a belief that the media are responsible for promoting false
      political beliefs or ideologies. In each case, media education is seen as
      a means of counteracting children’s apparent fascination and pleasure in
      the media – and hence their belief in the values the media are seen to
      promote. Media education will, it is assumed, lead children on to an
      appreciation of high culture, to more morally healthy forms of behaviour,
      or to more rational, politically correct beliefs.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      As in media research, there is sometimes an element of recurrence here, as
      new media enter the scene. For instance, the advent of the internet has
      seen a resurgence of many of these protectionist arguments for media
      education – arguments which have to some extent been superseded in
      respect of ‘older’ media such as television. Here, media education is
      yet again perceived by some as a kind of inoculation – a means of
      preventing contamination, if not of keeping children away from the media
      entirely. In this scenario, the potential benefits and pleasures of the
      media are neglected in favour of an exclusive – and in some instances,
      highly exaggerated – emphasis on the harm they are assumed to cause.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      While these protectionist views of media education have been far from
      superseded, there has been a gradual evolution in many countries towards a
      less defensive approach. In general, the countries with the most
      ‘mature’ forms of practice in media education – that is, those which
      have the longest history, and the most consistent pattern of evolution –
      have moved well beyond protectionism. From this perspective, media
      education is now no longer defined as a matter of automatic opposition to
      students’ experiences of the media. Media education is seen here not as
      a form of protection, but as a form of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">preparation</i>. It does not aim to shield young people from the
      influence of the media, and thereby to lead them on to ‘better things’.
      On the contrary, it seeks to enable them to make informed decisions on
      their own behalf. In broad terms, it aims to develop young people’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">understanding</i> of, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">participation</i>
      in, the media culture that surrounds them. In the process, it inevitably
      raises cultural, moral and political concerns; but it does so in a way
      that encourages an active, critical engagement on the part of students,
      rather than subservience to a predetermined position. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      From this perspective, media production by students inevitably assumes a
      much greater significance. At least in respect of children and young
      people of school age – who are the focus of this paper – media
      education is not primarily a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vocational</i>
      enterprise. Its aim is not to train the television producers and
      journalists of the future: this is a task for higher education, and for
      the media industries themselves. Nevertheless, the increasing economic
      importance of the media and communications industries means that the media
      are a growing area for employment. By emphasising the development of young
      people’s creativity, and their participation in media production, media
      educators are enabling their voices to be heard; and in the longer term,
      they are also providing the basis for more democratic and inclusive forms
      of media production in the future. <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The reasons for this shift in emphasis – from ‘protection’ to
      ‘preparation’ - are manifold, but the following would be among them:<o:p>

        views of regulation. </span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">To
        some extent, this shift is part of a broader development in thinking
        about the nature of media regulation. While protectionism is often
        driven by well-meaning, positive motivations, it can result in a
        situation where children’s active participation in the media is
        restricted. As such, it can be seen to conflict with the emphasis on
        children’s rights to information and participation (for example, in
        the UN Convention). Furthermore, the proliferation and technological
        development of the media in recent years has lead to a situation in
        which children’s access to media can no longer be so easily controlled:
        this is most obviously the case in relation to the internet, but it is
        also true of video and satellite television, for example. In this
        situation, the attempt to restrict children’s access to media is
        increasingly seen to be an impossible task. Among media regulators, the
        emphasis is now moving decisively away from censorship, and towards
        ‘consumer advice’ – of which media education is often seen as one
        dimension.<o:p>

        The notion of the media as bearers of a singular set of values and
        beliefs – or indeed as uniformly harmful or lacking in cultural value
        – is no longer so widely held. While there are obviously significant
        limits in the diversity of views represented in the media, the
        proliferation and globalisation of modern forms of communication have
        resulted in a more heterogeneous, even fragmented, environment. Although
        economic control of the media has largely become confined to a small
        number of global corporations, the growing importance of ‘niche
        markets’ has required producers to address an increasingly diverse
        range of social groupings. The participatory potential of new
        technologies – and particularly of the internet – has also helped to
        undermine the view of the media as a monolithic, centrally controlled
        machine; and this has made it much more possible for young people to
        undertake creative media production, or for teachers to do so with their
        students. In this context, therefore, there is a greater recognition of
        the benefits and opportunities afforded by the media, rather than simply
        of the harm they are alleged to cause.<o:p>

        Following from the above, the notion that the media are an all-powerful
        ‘consciousness industry’ – that they can single-handedly impose
        false values on passive audiences – has also come into question. In
        the case of children, the idea that they can be seen merely as innocent
        victims of media effects has steadily been challenged and surpassed.
        This is partly a reflection of changing perspectives among academics and
        researchers: within some areas of psychology, and particularly within
        Cultural Studies, researchers have developed a much more complex view of
        the ways in which children make judgments about the media, and how they
        use the media to form their personal and social identities. This general
        orientation is also supported by a growing body of work in the sociology
        of childhood (which itself has informed the interest in children’s
        rights). This research does not sanction the simple-minded celebration
        of children’s sophistication that has now become common within the
        media industries; but it does suggest that children are a much more
        autonomous and critical audience than they are conventionally assumed to
        be - not least by many educators themselves.<o:p>

        Finally – and perhaps most powerfully – there has been a growing
        recognition among educators that the protectionist approach does not
        actually work in practice. Such an approach often seems to be based on
        the notion that teachers will simply reveal the ‘truth’ about the
        shortcomings of the media, and that the students, once they have
        witnessed it, will automatically give their assent. Research and
        experience in this field suggest that this ‘evangelistic’ approach
        represents a severe over-simplification of the complex and messy
        realities of educational practice. Especially when it comes to the areas
        with which media education is so centrally concerned - with what
        students see as their own cultures and their own pleasures - they may
        well be inclined to resist or reject what teachers tell them. And this
        is particularly true if such teaching is perceived to be grounded on
        ignorance about popular culture, or if the study of the media is being
        used as a covert means of gaining students' assent to positions that are
        seen as morally authoritarian or ‘politically correct’. The
        recognition of these difficulties has led to the emergence of a more
        student-centred perspective, which begins from young people’s existing
        knowledge and experience of media, rather than from the instructional
        imperatives of the teacher.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Any account of this kind inevitably runs the risk of oversimplification.
      Changes in the overt philosophy or rhetoric of media education are by no
      means necessarily reflected in educational practice; and the reasons for
      such changes may be as much to do with contingency – or indeed with
      broader changes in the social or political climate – as they are to do
      with the ‘internal’ development of practice. As will be noted in a
      subsequent section of this paper, there is an urgent need for
      information-gathering in this field, and for a more systematic comparative
      analysis of international developments. Perhaps above all, there is a need
      to assess the rhetorical claims of media educators in the light of the
      concrete realities of practice. Ultimately, one of the abiding weaknesses
      of media education – not least for those who have sought to promote its
      importance among policy-makers – has been the lack of systematic,
      detailed evidence about its effectiveness.<o:p>

      In a developing field such as media education, diversity is to be expected;
      and a global organisation such as UNESCO is bound to respect and seek to
      preserve such diversity. As is implied above, media education needs to
      begin from the perspectives and experiences of young people themselves;
      and as such, it must take into account the needs and characteristics of
      their communities and cultures. This diversity cannot easily be
      accommodated within a singular model. Nevertheless, there is also a need
      for clarity and coherence if media education is to move beyond the stage
      of pioneering enthusiasm. We need authoritative definitions of its aims
      and methods, if only as a starting point for further debate. If
      policy-makers and others are to be convinced of the need for media
      education, they need to be sure about what it involves.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In fact, such definitions already exist. The model of media education
      codified in the British Film Institute’s ‘Curriculum Statements’,
      published in 1989 and 1991, emerged from a twenty-year history of
      curriculum development in the UK; and it has been highly influential
      internationally. Variants of this kind of model have been developed in
      many countries; and the British Film Institute itself has subsequently
      attempted to refine and simplify it. Nevertheless, there is a striking
      degree of consensus about the basic parameters. This model provides a
      framework for the curriculum organised not in terms of objects of study,
      or in terms of skills or competencies, but in terms of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">conceptual
      understandings</i>. These are often rendered as a set of ‘key concepts’
      or ‘aspects’. A simplified version of this model is outlined in Table
      1 below. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt 468.0pt 504.0pt 540.0pt 576.0pt 612.0pt 648.0pt 684.0pt 720.0pt 756.0pt 792.0pt 828.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This conceptual approach has several advantages. It does not specify a
      given set of facts to be learned; nor does it identify particular objects
      of study (a canon of prescribed texts, for example). In this respect, it
      enables media education to remain contemporary and responsive to students'
      changing interests and experiences, without becoming merely arbitrary in
      its selection of material. The central aim here is to provide a
      theoretical framework which can be applied to the whole range of
      contemporary media, and indeed to ‘older’ media such as literature as
      well. At least in principle, this should enable students to realise the
      connections between them, and to transfer insights from one area to
      another. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt 468.0pt 504.0pt 540.0pt 576.0pt 612.0pt 648.0pt 684.0pt 720.0pt 756.0pt 792.0pt 828.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, the key aspects are not intended as a blueprint for a media
      education curriculum, or a list of contents that should be ‘delivered’
      to students. They are not hierarchically organised, nor are they intended
      to be addressed in isolation from each other - as though one would spend
      one semester on agency, followed by another on representation, and so on.
      On the contrary, they are seen as interdependent: each concept is a
      possible point of entry to a given area of media education, which
      necessarily invokes all the others. As such, they provide a way of
      organising one's thinking about any activity or unit of work which might
      be undertaken in media education - and it should be emphasised that they
      can be applied as much to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">creative </i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>activities (such as taking photographs) as they can to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">analytical</i>
      ones (such as studying advertising or the news). <o:p>

      This conceptual model and others like it have informed curriculum
      development in several countries around the world; and this has
      particularly been the case in countries with the longest history of
      practice in the field. However, there is a need to undertake a systematic
      comparison between such models and frameworks, and to address some of the
      broader questions they raise. The following are among the questions that
      have begun to be raised in debates among practitioners, and in classroom
      research, over the past ten years:<o:p>

      Ultimately, despite their limitations, models and definitions of this kind
      provide an important basis for the ‘internal’ development of the field;
      as well as providing resources for dialogue with ‘external’ parties
      such as other subject teachers, educational policy makers, media

      Despite the growing significance of the media, and the urgency of the case
      for media education, progress in this field has generally been slow or
      uneven. Educational innovation of this kind is a complex process, and
      requires a range of strategies and tactics. It cannot be mandated, and it
      will not be brought about simply through the force or logic of the
      argument. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Skia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Experience in several countries suggests that promoting and developing
      media education depends upon the presence of a series of inter-dependent
      elements, and on partnerships between a range of interested parties. Some
      of these will function on an international level, some on a national level
      and some on a local level. Any intervention must necessarily take account
      of the specific factors in play at each level, and the shifting
      relationships between them. These elements should include the following.<o:p>

          interventions.</b> There is an ongoing need for clear, coherent and
          authoritative documents that define media education and provide a
          rationale for its implementation. The Grunwald Declaration is one
          example of such an international document, which can be effectively
          utilised at a national level by those seeking to influence educational
          policy. Such documents obviously need to command general assent; to be
          succinct and strongly argued; and to be widely publicised and
          distributed. A new document of this type, which reflects recent
          changes and likely future developments in the media, is now urgently
          required. If it is to be effective, any international document or
          policy statement of this kind will also need to be followed up with an
          ongoing process of monitoring at a national level.</span></li>

          frameworks.</b> In addition to broad statements of purpose, there is a
          need for more specific documentation outlining frameworks for
          curriculum development and practice. The model described in the
          previous section of this paper offers one such framework; and it has
          subsequently been adapted and developed in various ways in different
          contexts. In the current climate of educational policy-making in many
          countries, a document of this kind would need to include: a clear
          model of learning progression, appropriate to specific curriculum
          locations; details of specific learning outcomes, expressed in terms
          of competencies; criteria and procedures for evaluation and assessment;
          and, in some instances, specific attainment targets for given stages.
          Ideally, any such document will need to allow considerable opportunity
          for flexibility and teacher autonomy, while nevertheless ensuring
          comparability and agreed standards. Documents of this kind certainly
          exist, although they remain to be drawn together, evaluated and

          training for teachers and other practitioners.</b> Well-intended
          documents and frameworks are worthless without trained staff to
          implement them. Elements of training in media education should be
          included in initial and in-service training programmes, and be
          available as part of teachers’ ongoing professional development.
          Teachers should be rewarded for undertaking training, both by
          additional remuneration and by appropriate certification. Given the
          complexity of the field, any such training should be extensive and
          sustained: one-off conferences and short courses are obviously of
          value for those new to the field, but there should be flexible
          opportunities to lead on to more in-depth training, for example at
          Master’s level. In line with best practice in professional
          development, such training should include opportunities to undertake
          practically-based investigations, and offer provision for the
          accreditation of prior learning. Distance learning may be appropriate
          in many circumstances, but this should be complemented by sustained
          opportunities for face-to-face tuition. (It should be emphasised that
          the term ‘teachers’ here includes those who work with young people
          in more informal settings, such as youth and community projects. While
          circumstances vary, such individuals are often even more inadequately

          obvious vehicle for media education: in some respects, they are bound
          to teach the skills and competencies that are needed to interpret them.
          However, media producers often need to be convinced of their
          responsibility to provide media education, both ‘informally’
          though their own work, and through partnerships with teachers and
          other education providers. Collaboration between teachers and media
          producers has obvious benefits, for instance in terms of accessing
          appropriate teaching resources, informing teachers and students of
          contemporary developments within the media industries, and addressing
          students’ vocational ambitions. This can take the form of
          co-operative projects, visits, placements and work-shadowing, the
          production of teaching materials, screenings and so on. Such
          activities are not necessarily incompatible with commercial interests;
          although they should not be seen simply as an opportunity for media
          producers to advertise their work, or as a form of ‘public relations’.
          Other bodies that might have a role to play in this respect would

          media education is to prove relevant and applicable beyond the
          classroom, parents and caregivers clearly have a vital role to play.
          Many parents express concern about the media to which their children
          are exposed, and feel relatively powerless to intervene. Because they
          themselves have had little media education, they believe they have
          little understanding about the media. If parents are to be involved,
          they too need to be recruited and empowered as active participants,
          rather than simply being told what they should or should not be doing;
          and any educational initiatives aimed at parents need to take account
          both of cultural differences and of the sometimes difficult realities
          of child-rearing. While there are examples of good practice in this
          field that might be productively shared and disseminated more widely,

          provision of facilities, training and support for more or less
          independent groups of young people is a further key dimension of media
          education. Such groups may come together in formal school settings,
          but they are likely to function more effectively in less formal
          situations; and (as noted above), media educators may have a great
          deal to learn from the kinds of ‘peer education’ that are
          developed in such contexts. There is a great potential for young media
          professionals to be involved in such work, particularly with
          disadvantaged groups who might not otherwise gain access to the media.
          While there is a long history of practice in this field, there has
          been relatively little documentation or dialogue among practitioners;
          and training opportunities are uneven and often quite inadequate. Such
          groups can obviously benefit greatly from networking with peers in
          similar situations; and there is an urgent need to establish channels

          providing additional training to support their use. Such materials
          should be of high quality, not necessarily in terms of glossy
          production values but more in terms of the research and evaluation

          specify the levels of resourcing that are required for effective

          the nature of student learning about the media; the relations between

          although there is much that media educators in those countries could
          learn from the rather different traditions of the developing countries
          of the South. In addition, there is a need for such dialogues and
          exchanges to be sustained, rather than merely in the form of one-off
          conferences taking place every few years. International exchange will
          be much less superficial if practitioners have more sustained
          opportunities to visit each other’s countries, for example through a
          system of longer-term internships.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>

      </span>It should be emphasised here that these are all inter-related
      elements within an overall strategy. If any one of these is absent or
      weakened, it puts the entire field at risk. For instance, policy
      documentation or curriculum frameworks in the absence of professional
      development can be merely a matter of empty rhetoric. Professional
      development and self-organisation by teachers is fairly meaningless if
      there are no clear curriculum frameworks for them to work within. Policy,
      teaching and research should be interconnected: development in each area
      should support development in the others. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      We live in a world where media are omnipresent: an increasing number of
      people spend a great deal of time watching television, reading newspapers
      and magazines, playing records and listening to the radio. In some
      countries, for example, children already spend more time watching
      television than they do attending school.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Rather than condemn or endorse the undoubted power of the media, we need
      to accept their significant impact and penetration throughout the world as
      an established fact, and also appreciate their importance as an element of
      culture in today’s world. The role of communication and media in the
      process of development should not be underestimated, nor the function of
      media as instruments for the citizen’s active participation in society.
      Political and educational systems need to recognise their obligations to
      promote in their citizens a critical understanding of the phenomena of
      communication.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;Regrettably most formal and non-formal educational systems do little
      to promote media education or education for communication. Too often the
      gap between the educational experience they offer and the real world in
      which people live is disturbingly wide. But if the arguments for media
      education as a preparation for responsible citizenship are formidable now,
      in the very near future with the development of communication technology
      such as satellite broadcasting, two-way cable systems, television data
      systems, video cassette and disc materials, they ought to be irresistible,
      given the increasing degree of choice in media consumption resulting from
      these developments.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Responsible educators will not ignore these developments, but will work
      alongside their students in understanding them and making sense of such
      consequences as the rapid development of two-way communication and the
      ensuing individualisation and access to information.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This is not to underestimate the impact on cultural identity of the flow
      of information and ideas between cultures by the mass media.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The school and the family share the responsibility of preparing the young
      person for living in a world of powerful images, words and sounds.
      Children and adults need to be literate in all three of these symbolic
      systems, and this will require some reassessment of educational priorities.
      Such a reassessment might well result in an integrated approach to the
      teaching of language and communication.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Media education will be most effective when parents, teachers, media
      personnel and decision-makers all acknowledge that they have a role to
      play in developing greater critical awareness among listeners, viewers and
      readers. The greater integration of educational and communications systems
      would undoubtedly be an important step towards more effective education.<o:p>
