      It is a truism that the purpose of teaching is to help students learn. 'Yet
      in the past teaching and learning were most often seen as two separate,
      even polar, processes. Teaching was what teachers did. They were supposed
      to know their subject matter and be able to explain it well. Students were
      supposed to do the learning. They were expected to work hard, practice,
      and listen to understand. lf they didn’t learn, it was their fault; they
      had a learning disability, they needed remediation, they were preoccupied,
      they were lazy. Even when we spoke of development, it was usually to
      assess learners to see whether they were developmentally ready for the
      teacher's instruction. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:26.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Interestingly, in some languages, <i>learning </i>and <i>teaching</i> are
      the same word. In Dutch, for example, the distinction between learning and
      teaching is made only by the preposition. The verb is the same. <i>Leren
      aan</i> means teaching; <i>leren van</i> means learning. When learning and
      teaching are so closely related, they will be integrated in learning/teaching
      frameworks: teaching will be seen as closely related to learning, not only
      in language and thought but also in action. lf learning doesn’t happen,
      there has been no teaching. The actions of learning and teaching are
      inseparable. <o:p>

PT;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, different teachers
      have different styles for helping children learn. But behind these styles
      are frameworks based on teachers' beliefs about the learning/teaching
      process. These frameworks, in turn, affect how teachers interact with
      children, what questions they ask, what ideas they pursue, even what
      activities they design or select. Teachers make many important decisions -
      some of them in a split second in the nitty-gritty of the classroom. In
      making these decisions, some teachers are led by the structure of
      mathematics or the textbook series, others by the development of the
      children.</span>

      Join us in Madeline Chang’s K-1 classroom in New York City, and let's
      try to determine what learning/teaching framework underlies her decision
      making.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Hey ... I see a pattern!&quot; exclaims Roland, excitedly. He is
      referring to a big chart depicting combinations of dimes and pennies; his
      classmates are all nestled around him on the meeting rug.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.95pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Earlier Madeline had told the twenty-seven students in her class about her
      grandmother in China, who made beautiful glass bead necklaces. For several
      weeks the children have been making similar necklaces using five beads of
      one color, then five of another, then repeating five of the first color,
      five of the second, and so on. They have made a lot of different sizes,
      some small enough to be bracelets. They plan the necklaces first by making
      drawings or using Unifix cubes, since the beads are tiny, made of glass,
      and expensive. The necklaces will be sold at a PTA meeting for a penny a
      bead. Today the students are calculating how much each piece of jewelry
      will cost and making big charts of the combinations of dimes and pennies
      customers can use to pay for them. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;See,&quot; Roland continues excitedly, &quot;there is a two over
      there [<i>he points to the numeral 2 under the picture of a dime</i>] and
      a zero there <i>[he points to the O under the picture of the penny</i>],
      and those are the same numbers in the twenty! And it's the same with the
      fourteen. It's a one [<i>dime</i>] and a four [<i>pennies</i>]!&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Oh wow, Roland, that's interesting,&quot; Madeline says with
      pleasure. She has designed this investigation with just this &quot;horizon”
      of place value in mind. She hoped that by suggesting the students charge a
      dime for ten beads and by having them make charts listing the resulting
      costs, the patterns Roland is now noticing would become the focus of a
      discussion. To enhance this important mathematical teaching moment, she
      attempts to pull other children into the conversation. &quot;Who
      understands what Roland is noticing?&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;I do,&quot; says Tara, jumping up to join Roland at the chart.
      &quot;See, 1 and 4, that's 14, and 2 and 0, that's 20.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Madeline tries to heighten the mathematical teaching moment by creating a
      little puzzlement. &quot;But one and four added together don’t make
      fourteen. How much do they make?&quot; She succeeds. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:1.9pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Five,&quot; Tara responds with a perplexed expression. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Yes,&quot; Madeline acknowledges. &quot;So why would the chart have
      this pattern, I wonder?&quot; She looks around at the many intent, puzzled
      faces. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:2.4pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Oh ... I think I know.&quot; </span><span lang="FR" style="mso-ansi-language:FR">Ellie
      ventures a tentative explanation. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:2.4pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Goes up to four?&quot; Madeline repeats. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:2.4pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ellie explains, this time with a little more conviction. &quot;One dime
      equals ten cents, so it goes up to fourteen, not five.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:1.65pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Stephen joins the conversation. &quot;I know what she means. lf you move
      the O over to the 1, it makes the 10. lt looks like ten, but it isn't.&quot;
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:1.65pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;No, it is,&quot; Ellie shakes her head in disagreement, &quot;because
      it's not one penny, it's one dime. it looks like just one cent, but it is
      under the dime and one dime equals ten cents.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:2.4pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This idea, that ten things (in a group) can also be one group, is such a
      big idea for these children! They have only recently figured out how to
      count meaningfully, attributing only one counting word to each object, and
      now this original counting strategy seems contradicted! It is not one word
      for one object, but one word for a group of ten! How can ten
      simultaneously be one? <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ellie's argument begins to convince several of the other children, so
      Madeline extends the discussion. &quot;What about where the numeral two is
      by twenty cents?&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;That's two dimes!&quot; several children exclaim in unison. Madeline
      challenges their thinking again. &quot;I wonder if the zero will happen
      more often? What other amounts might have no pennies?&quot; This idea is
      difficult. Although several children can see that fourteen is made up of
      ten and four - or one ten and four extras - and that twenty is made up of
      two tens, can they extend this idea to other numbers? To really understand
      place value, a reflective abstraction needs to occur - that is, the
      pattern they are noticing has to be extended from these specific cases to
      numbers in general (Piaget 1977). <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.6pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ellie offers another conjecture. &quot;I think maybe thirty. Probably ten,
      Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, and a
      hundred have no pennies.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.05pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;So now we can check out Ellie's conjecture. Look what you started,
      Roland!&quot; Madeline smiles warmly at Ellie and Roland and they beam
      back.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This glimpse into Madeline's
      classroom reveals a very different approach to mathematics from the one
      most of us experienced in our past schooling. Traditionally mathematics
      has been perceived as a ready-made discipline to be handed down by a
      teacher skilled in the art of transmitting, or explaining, clearly. In the
      classrooms most of us have attended, teachers stood at the chalkboard and
      explained place value, many of them using only the symbols and words. Some
      may have used base-ten blocks or bundled straws to explain how ten objects
      became one ten; a few may even have introduced games like Chip Trading,
      hoping that making these transactions would lead </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">to
      an understanding of place value. But the premise was always the same. The
      teacher was the fountain of wisdom who understood that mathematics was a
      discipline thought to comprise facts, skills, concepts, formulas, and
      algorithms, and this discipline could be transmitted, explained, practiced,
      and learned if teachers were well versed in it and learners were diligent.
      Most students in mathematics classrooms did not see mathematics as
      creative, but instead as something to be explained by their teacher, then
      practiced and applied. One might call this traditional view &quot;school
      mathematics.&quot; <u1:p>
      </u1:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mathematicians, on the other hand, engage in quite a different practice.
      They make meaning in their world by setting up quantifiable and spatial
      relationships, by noticing patterns and transformations, by proving them
      as generalizations, and by searching for elegant solutions. They construct
      new mathematics to solve real problems or to explain or prove interesting
      patterns, relationships, or puzzles in mathematics itself. The renowned
      mathematician David Hilbert once commented that he liked to prove things
      in at least three or four different ways, because by doing so he better
      understood the relationships involved. At the heart of mathematics is the
      process of setting up relationships and trying to prove these
      relationships, mathematically, in order to communicate them to others.
      Creativity is at the core of what mathematicians do. <u1:p>

      Interestingly, the sculptor Henry Moore described his work in much the
      same way Hilbert did. He said that before he sculpted, he always drew
      something several times to learn more about it. In fact, we all find ways
      to make meaning from our interactions in the world. The process of
      constructing meaning is the process of learning. We actually create our
      knowledge; we do not discover it, Writers make meaning when they formulate
      stories and narratives, when they construct characters and plots, when
      they play with words and metaphors. Scientists make meaning by wondering
      about scientific phenomena, by hypothesizing, designing, and performing
      experiments, and then by proposing explanations to fit their results,
      Musicians hear cadence, rhythm, harmony, discordance, and melody as they
      interact in their world; artists see color, form, texture, and line. <u1:p>

      In fields other than mathematics, we've understood this constructive
      nature of learning. We teach students to become good writers by involving
      them in the process of writing. In science, we engage learners in actively
      inquiring, in formulating hypotheses, and in designing experiments. We
      teach art by allowing learners to create it. Have we traditionally been
      teaching mathematics in our classrooms or only the &quot;history&quot; of
      mathematics - some past mathematicians' constructions and their
      applications? Is there any connection at all between &quot;school
      mathematics&quot; and &quot;real mathematics&quot;? <u1:p>

      The vignette from Madeline’s classroom is evidence of a different view
      of mathematics - one more closely akin to the process of constructing
      meaning, that might be better termed &quot;mathematizing.&quot; Children
      are organizing information into charts and tables, noticing and exploring
      patterns, putting forth explanations and conjectures, and trying to
      convince one another of their thinking - all processes that beg a verb
      form. This view of mathematics was put forth by the well-known
      twentieth-century Dutch mathematician Hans Freudenthal (1968) when he
      argued that mathematics was a human activity - the process of modeling
      reality with the use of mathematical tools. <u1:p>

      Madeline immerses her students in an investigation grounded in context. As
      they make &quot;architectural drafts&quot; of the intended jewelry and
      complete charts to be used when selling the items, they notice numerical
      patterns in their data. They explore these patterns and try to figure out
      why they are happening. Throughout the process, they raise their own
      mathematical questions and discuss them in the mathematical community of
      their classroom. But is this only process? What about content? Do all the
      children construct an understanding of place value? Is place value even
      the goal that day for all the children?</span>

      <p style="margin-top:4.8pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Let's go back to Madeline's classroom on a day prior to the one on which
      the children are discussing the pattern Roland notices. On this day, Cathy
      Fosnot, a Mathematics in the City coteacher, is also in the room. Cathy is
      sitting with Tara and Sarah, who are making a drawing of a red-and-green
      necklace that will have twenty-two beads. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sarah is carefully counting each bead on her drawing. So far, she has
      drawn three groups of five - five red, five green, then five red. She
      counts by ones, tagging each bead with her finger, and saying one number
      for each bead, in synchrony with her touch. When she gets to fifteen, she
      draws four new green beads one at a time on the same side of the necklace
      saying, &quot;Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2.15pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Tara interrupts her. &quot;You need more than that, and you need five of
      each color.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:4.3pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sarah adds another green bead and then, rather than saying, &quot;Twenty,&quot;
      counts all the beads from one again until she reaches twenty. Then she
      draws two more green beads on the other side and says, &quot;Twenty-one,
      twenty-two. There. We're done.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:3.6pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Sarah's counting strategy of returning to one, rather than counting on
      from nineteen, is typical of many young children. To understand that
      nineteen is inside of twenty, that numbers are nested inside of cach other
      (like Russian nesting dolls), and that the difference grows by one each
      time is another big idea for children (Kamii 1985). They must construct,
      first, the idea that <i>twenty </i>means twenty things. They see adults in
      their environment count to see &quot;how many.&quot; And although children
      can copy these actions and learn the singsong of counting, they do not
      necessarily understand that the result of the counting represents an
      amount. Even when this idea is constructed, it is still a big leap for
      them to infer that 20 = 19 + 1. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:3.1pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Tara has constructed these ideas. She explains to Sarah that nineteen
      beads are not enough - she knows that nineteen is inside of twenty-two.
      Sarah, on the other hand, is in the midst of constructing these ideas. She
      counts by ones as she works, and when interrupted by Tara, she cannot
      retain the nineteen and count on. Nor does she look at the beads and count
      by fives to recapture the amount. She must start over again, from one. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Cathy wants these girls, particularly Sarah, to think about the amounts.
      One way to do this is to have them consider the relation between the
      number of pennies and the number of beads. Another is to have them
      consider the groups of fives nested within the twenty-two beads. Skip
      counting by fives would be more efficient than recounting from one. To
      that end, Cathy hands the girls an ink pad and coin stamps (penny, nickel,
      and dime) and asks them to figure out how much they should charge for the
      necklace. What should the customers pay? Then she moves to another section
      of the room, where Madeline is working with Graham and Ellie. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Graham and Ellie are drafting their necklaces with Unifix cubes and laying
      them out in a line. They are working next to a hundreds chart. Ellie
      exclaims, &quot;Hey, Graham, 1 found another one ... 16! See?&quot; She
      lays out a train of Unifix cubes: five brown, five yellow, five brown, one
      yellow. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Yeah, that's another one that fits your rule,&quot; Graham
      acknowledges. &quot;My rule's the opposite,&quot; he explains to Madeline.
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;What do you mean by the opposite?&quot; Madeline inquires. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Well, because I didn’t have trouble with twenty,&quot; Ellie
      interjects. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;And i did have trouble with twelve,&quot; Graham finishes. &quot;See?
      When you attach the twelve together into a necklace [<i>he takes a Unifix
      train of five yellow, five brown, and two yellow and lays it in front of
      Madeline</i>] you get seven yellow in a row. Trouble!&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>

PT;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graham and Ellie have become
      intrigued with the idea that some amounts, when made into a necklace, will
      not follow the pattern of groups of five. For example, twelve beads, when
      turned into a circular necklace, will not work. The five yellow on one
      side and the two yellow on the other will become seven yellow in a row
      when a circle is made. The pattern of fives will be lost (sec Figure 1.
      1a). A necklace of twenty, however, forms a perfectly alternating &quot;groups
      of five&quot; necklace. Ellie is interested in the amounts that will keep
      the pattern of fives intact, with at least one bead of a different color
      breaking up the groups (see Figure 1. I b).&nbsp;</span>

      Madeline begins to understand. &quot;Oh, you mean when you tie the real
      necklace together, the yellow will look like seven instead of five and two?&quot;
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:.95pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Yeah.&quot; Graham raises his hands, palms turned out, and shakes
      his head in an exasperated fashion, obviously intrigued by the dilemma.
      &quot;Then how is your rule the opposite, Ellie?&quot; Madeline asks.
      Ellie points to the hundreds chart, &quot;Ten, twenty, thirty, forty,
      fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred. All these numbers
      won't be trouble.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:.2pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Why won't they be trouble?&quot; &quot;Maybe because they're all
      even numbers,&quot; Ellie ponders. &quot;I think here <i>[she points to
      21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91] </i>... these are all odd. 1 bet we'll
      have trouble.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:1.65pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Ellie notices an odd/even relation and offers it as a possible explanation
      of why some numbers might work. Although it is of course true that all the
      perfect necklaces are made up of even numbers (10, 20, 30, etc.), the
      reverse is not true: all even numbers do not make perfect necklaces, nor
      do they even make necklaces that fit Ellie's rule. Yet as is often the
      case, even a wrong idea can provide a powerful mathematical insight. Thus,
      talking about ideas - the social community of mathematicians - can be
      instrumental in fostering the development of knowledge. Such is the case
      here. As Ellie puts forth her insight, Graham picks up on it; they
      scaffold their ideas, each upon the others. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:2.15pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Yeah!&quot; Graham exclaims. &quot;The odd fives when you put them
      together won't look good, because you get another number. But the even
      ones, when you put them together ... you won't get into trouble!&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:.7pt;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Note the language Graham uses: &quot;odd fives.&quot; Ellie had mentioned
      odd numbers, not odd fives. His insight into this problem is amazing. He
      is not only able to consider the fives as groups of five, he is able to
      consider the <i>number of groups</i> as even or odd! For a five-year-old,
      this is brilliant mathematics - a beautiful, elegant creation. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      And now Ellie picks up on this idea and creates an even more encompassing
      solution. &quot;Hey, I just figured something else out! </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US">With numbers </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">ending
      in five, four, three, two, or one, you’ll always have trouble, but with
      six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, you'll never have trouble!&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Wow, that's an interesting conjecture, Ellie! Check it out and keep
      me posted. 1'11 be back.&quot; Madeline is exuberant over the mathematics
      these two children are doing, but she knows they need time to explore
      further. If she acknowledges their solution now as correct, they will
      accept her word for it and stop thinking. To really understand, learners
      must work out their ideas thoroughly. They must be able to prove
      relationships to themselves and to their peers. And, as Hilbert said, it's
      even more powerful to prove it several ways! <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Madeline also admittedly wants time to explore for herself the mathematics
      involved in Ellie's and Grahams conjectures. Children’s inquiries often
      take them on a journey the teacher has not yet explored! This is often the
      case with mathematicians, too: ones questions spur another to investigate.
      Rather than feeling anxious over the new mathematics that arises, we can
      enjoy the investigation as well. We should view our role not as the
      provider of answers, but as the facilitator in learning. We can plan, but
      also partake in, the journey of constructing ways to mathematize our world.
      Madeline makes a note to herself to work on this conjecture of Ellie’s
      and Graham's that night, then her eyes roam across the room to ensure that
      all twenty-seven students are involved in their work. Since everyone seems
      to be, she sits down to listen in on the conversation of three other
      children. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Cathy returns to Sarah and Tara. They have stamped four nickels and two
      pennies on their drawing of the necklace with twenty-two beads. Responding
      to a question from Cathy, Tara demonstrates with her fingers the groups of
      five, saying, &quot;One five, a second five, a third five, a fourth five.
      So customers have to give us four nickels and two pennies.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.7pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &quot;Oh, I see. That makes sense.&quot; Cathy acknowledges her agreement
      with the girls' thinking, noticing with interest that Tara is counting by
      fives and then counting the groups. But what about Sarah? She seems to
      agree with Tara, since she is nodding, but it is often difficult for a
      teacher to know whether <i>each </i>child really understands. To give
      Sarah more time to grapple with Tara's ideas, Cathy suggests they figure
      out what customers would pay if they used dimes. She leaves the girls to
      work on that question, then she visits Raul and Pete. They have drawn a
      necklace of fifteen beads. Cathy asks them how they know it is fifteen. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.7pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Pete explains, skip counting by fives: &quot;Five, ten, fifteen.&quot; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      However, Cathy sees that although the boys have stamped three nickels on
      their drawing, they have also stamped ten pennies alongside the nickels,
      for a total of thirteen coins. She asks them how much money that is,
      commenting that it looks like an expensive necklace for only fifteen beads.
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.7pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Raul counts the coins by ones, &quot;One, two, three, four, five, six,
      seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven -&quot; <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.2pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Cathy stops him at eleven, pointing to the nickel. &quot;How many beads is
      the nickel for?&quot; she asks. &quot;The nickel is worth five cents,
      isn’t it?&quot; <o:p>

      Cathy’s question, acknowledging the nickel is worth five cents but still
      counting eleven, twelve, thirteen. Cathy tries several other questions to
      bring out the unitizing, but she is unsuccessful and the boys begin to
      lose interest.&nbsp;</span>

      As Madeline and Cathy wander from group to group, their questioning
      changes in relation to what the children are investigating and in relation
      to the ideas each child is in the midst of constructing. Although place
      value is the overall &quot;horizon” – a general goal purposely
      embedded in the context by Madeline - each child is at a different place
      developmentally, and therefore the context is also open enough to allow
      for individual exploration and divergence. Asking Tara and Sarah to figure
      out the cost gives them the opportunity to revisit the quantity of
      twenty-two. Sarah has originally counted by ones, even starting over when
      she goes from the nineteenth to the twentieth bead. The coins can become a
      &quot;constraint&quot; to counting by ones and therefore may facilitate
      the development of counting on, skip counting, or unitizing (i.e., five
      cents is also one group of five). <u1:p>
      </u1:p>
      <o:p>

      Since Ellie and Graham are already able to unitize, Madeline's questions
      center on the patterns they have noticed in relation to odd and even
      groups of five and leftovers. As they continue their explanations, they
      are actually dividing various amounts into fives, and Madeline hopes they
      may be able to construct the relationship between even groups of five and
      groups of ten. <u1:p>

      In both these instances, the learning seems smooth. The children’s
      inquiries bring wonderful mathematical opportunities to the fore, and the
      teachers' questions seem to be helpful. Learning - real learning - is not
      always so smooth, however, as the dialogue with Pete and Raul demonstrates.
      Although Cathy tries to provoke disequilibrium in relation to their scheme
      of counting the nickels as ones, she is unsuccessful. The boys are not yet
      capable of making the connection between one nickel and five beads. Or
      perhaps they can (they do represent the three groups of five with three
      nickels), but their understanding falls apart when they try to consider
      the whole of fifteon. lt is also possible they understand unitizing but
      are simply counting coins. Often the best questions are those that simply
      illuminate the learner's thinking, but in the middle of teaching this is
      hard to remember. Teachers tend to focus, lead, or ask questions in
      relation to their own (the teachers) agenda - and Cathy falls prey to that
      tendency here. <u1:p>
      </u1:p>
      <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-top:.95pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Even so, all the children are immersed in an investigation that involves
      mathematizing. And more than process is happening. Children are exploring
      ideas such as quantity, unitizing, and division, in relation to their own
      level of mathematical development. And mathematizing should not be
      dismissed as simply process. Mathematizing is content. As children learn
      to recognize, be intrigued by, and explore patterns, as they begin to
      overlay and interpret experiences, contexts, and phenomena with
      mathematical questions, tools (tables and charts), and models (the linear
      Unifix train vs. the circular necklace), they are constructing an
      understanding of what it really means to be a mathematician - to organize
      and interpret their world through a mathematical lens. This is the essence
      of mathematics.&nbsp; <o:p>

      Madeline supports her students by posing questions and offering rich
      contexts for mathematizing. This approach enables children to take the
      next step in the learning process. The development of the children seems
      to guide Madeline's teaching. But development can be nothing more than a
      catch-word. No one would disagree that development is important. Educators
      have talked about developmentally appropriate practice for years. But what
      does development <i>in relation to mathematics learning and teaching</i>
      mean? <u1:p>

      Madeline's teaching reflects her appropriate understanding of development.
      But she does more - she employs a different framework. Her teaching is
      grounded in the development of <i>mathematical ideas</i> - in her
      knowledge of the structure of mathematics. But still there is more. She
      understands the paths and the horizons of the landscape of this learning;
      she knows how children <i>come to understand</i> different mathematical
      ideas. She thinks about how to employ <i>mathematical contexts </i>as a
      didactic - how to use them to facilitate mathematical learning. She knows
      and recognizes important land - marks along the way - strategies, big
      ideas, and mathematical models - and she designs her contexts with these
      landmarks in mind. Different contexts have the potential to generate
      different models, strategies, and big ideas. <u1:p>

      The mind is never a blank slate. Even at birth, infants have organized
      patterns of behavior - or schemes (Piaget 1977) - for learning and
      understanding the world. Beginning as reflexes (grasping and orienting,
      for example), these initial schemes soon become differentiated and
      coordinated. Children learn to crawl and then walk to objects to be
      grasped, felt, sucked, and explored visually. Grasping is refined to
      include pushing, pulling, hitting, and other forms of exploring with the
      fingers. Sucking is differentiated into chewing, biting, and licking. New
      strategies for exploration are constructed. <u1:p>

      Children attempting to understand &quot;how many&quot; - how many plums
      there are in the grocer's box, how many stairs they have climbed, how many
      fish there are in the fish tank - use various assimilatory schemes. They
      hold up three fingers to show perceptual correspondence; they line up
      objects one to one; they count (often double-tagging some objects).
      Sometimes they count the same objects over and over again (when counting
      fish in the fish tank, for example)! Eventually they learn to tag and
      count each object once and only once, and they learn to count on. These
      strategies in turn evolve into strategies for addition and subtraction,
      counting backward, skip counting, and taking leaps of ten. <u1:p>

      progression of strategies is the construction of some essential big ideas.
      What is a &quot;big idea&quot; and how is it different from a strategy?
      Big ideas are &quot;the central, organizing ideas of mathematics -
      principles that define mathematical order&quot; (Schifter and Fosnot 1993,
      35). As such, they are deeply connected to the structures of mathematics.
      They are, however, also characteristic of shifts in learners' reasoning -
      shifts in perspective, in logic, in the mathematical
      relationships they set up. As such, they are connected to part/whole
      relationships - to the structure of thought in general (Piaget 1977). In
      fact, that is <i> why</i> they are connected to the structures of mathematics. As
      mathematical ideas developed through the centuries and across cultures,
      the advances were often characterized by paradigmatic shifts in reasoning.
      These ideas are &quot;big&quot; because they are critical to mathematics
      and because they are big leaps in the development of children’s
      reasoning. <o:p>

      <i> unitizing</i> is one big
      idea we saw children grappling with in Madeline's class. Unitizing
      underlies the understanding of place value; ten objects become one ten.
      Unitizing requires that children use number to count not only objects but
      also groups - and to count them both simultaneously. The whole is thus seen
      as a group of a number of objects. The parts together become the new whole,
      and the parts (the objects in the group) and the whole (the group) can be
      considered simultaneously. If we know the number of beads in a necklace
      and how many beads are in a group, we can figure out the number of groups,
      or the number of nickels, dimes, and pennies to charge. For learners,
      unitizing is a shift in perspective. Children have just learned to count
      ten objects, one by one. Unitizing these <i> ten</i> things as <i> one</i>
      thing - one group - requires almost negating their original idea of number. It is a huge
      shift in thinking for children, and in fact, was a huge shift in
      mathematics, taking centuries to develop. <o:p>

      Language was constructed to signify meaning. When we construct an idea, we
      want to communicate it: through time and across cultures humans have
      developed language to do so. Initially, language represents ideas and

      To speak of mathematics as mathematizing demands that we address
      mathematical models and their development. To mathematize, one sees,
      organizes, and interprets the world through and with mathematical models.
      like language, these models often begin as simply representations of
      situations, or problems, by learners. For example, learners may initially
      represent a situation with Unifix cubes or with a drawing, as the children
      did when they drafted their necklaces. These models of situations
      eventually become generalized as learners explore connections between and
      across them. As Graham and Ellie modeled the necklaces linearly and then
      circularly, they were puzzled because of the &quot;tension” between the
      models. Then they shifted to a generalized notion of number, employing the
      numerals on the hundreds chart to continue their inquiry. Using numerals
      to signify their original models, they further mathematized their
      understanding of the situation. The hundreds chart became a tool to think
      with. <o:p>

      Madeline walks the edge between the structure of mathematics and the
      development of the child by considering the progression of strategies, the
      big ideas involved, and the emergent models. Ultimately what matters is
      the mathematical activity of the learner - how the learner mathematizes
      the situations that Madeline designs. But learning - development-is
      complex. Strategies, big ideas, and models are all involved - they all
      need to be developed as they affect one another. They are the steps, the
      shifts, and the mental maps in the journey. They are the components in a

      strategies, as structuring rather than as big ideas, and as modeling
      rather than as models (Freudenthal 1991). Teaching needs to facilitate
      this development. Only then can teaching and learning be seen as

      Look again at the epigraphs to this chapter. &quot;It's the questions that
      drive mathematics. Solving problems and making up new ones is the essence
      of mathematical life. lf mathematics is conceived apart from mathematical
      life, of course it seems - dead.&quot; When mathematics is understood as
      mathematizing one's world - interpreting, organizing, inquiring about, and
      constructing meaning with a mathematical lens, it becomes creative and
      alive. 'The mathematician’s patterns, like the painter's or the poet's,
      must be beautiful.... There is no permanent place in the world for ugly
      mathematics.&quot; <u1:p>

      Traditionally mathematics has been taught in our schools as if it were a
      dead language. It was something that past, mostly dead, mathematicians had
      created - something that needed to be learned, practiced, and applied.
      When the definition of mathematics shifts toward &quot;the activity of
      mathematizing one's <i>lived world</i>,&quot; the constructive nature of
      the discipline and its connection to problem solving become clear. <u1:p>

      When we define mathematics in this way, and teach accordingly, children
      will rise to the challenge. They will grapple with mathematical ideas;
      they will develop and refine strategies as they search for elegance; they
      will create mathematical models as they attempt to understand and
      represent their world. Because this process of mathematizing is
      constructive, teachers need to walk the edge between the structure of
      mathematics and the development of the learner. This edge is a journey
      across a landscape of learning that comprises strategies, big ideas, and
      models. From the perspective of mathematics as mathematizing, it is the
      mathematical activity of the learner that ultimately matters; thus,
      strategies, big ideas, and models need to be understood as schematizing,
      structuring, and modeling. Teaching needs to be seen as inherently
      connected to learning. <u1:p>
