This
article is based on an international analysis of courses on the Internet, and it
provides strategic recommendations about issues of importance to online
education. The recommendations are based on literature reviews, catalogue
entries submitted by 130 institutions in 26 countries, and 72 interviews with
key persons at these institutions. The catalogue data were collected from March
98 to February 99 and the interviews were conducted in the spring of 1999.<o:p>

There is
a steady growth of institutions that offer online courses to students in other
countries, and the analysis presents many examples of international
collaboration and thinking. However, most of the global initiatives seem to be
experiments and ambitions rather than main priorities. One important barrier is
the problems with acceptance of foreign degrees, certificates, credits, and
grades as an integral part of education and professional development.
International collaboration will benefit from an harmonization on these
important issues. North American universities may have a competitive advantage
compared with Europe since North American universities have a relatively long
tradition of credit transfer.<o:p>
&nbsp;</font>
</span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accreditation
could be an important competitive advantage and several strategies could be
followed to achieve the necessary accreditation. Collaboration with institutions
in other countries could result in bilateral accreditation.</font></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A
country should allow its universities and colleges to charge tuition fees for
web-based course. Countries that don’t can hardly be competitive in the
emerging global educational marketplace. Tuition fees can stimulate change,
facilitate collaboration between institutions, and be an incentive for export of
courses. Examples from both Germany and Sweden show that these countries
restrictions are perceived as a barrier for online education.</font></span></p>

The
analysis indicates that there are few institutions that can claim that provision
of web-based courses has been an economic success, if they disregard external
research and development grants. At the same time, most of the web-courses have
relatively low enrolment. The cost of development and maintenance could be high,
and there are many examples of expensive pilot projects that experiment with
high-cost, state-of-the art technology. All this imply that it is necessary to
focus much more on how online education could become more cost effective. This
include a focus on how online courses could handle larger enrolment and
prioritizing cost effective technology and development schemes.</font></span></p>

Institutions
that plan to offer large scale and professional online education need an
administrative system that is integrated with the web. A discouraging, but
important observation is that a number of institutions do not use the web for
administrative purposes. Many of the administrative solutions are primitive, and
much could be done to improve most of the existing systems. The standard,
commercial systems are continuously being improved, but they may still need much
local adaptation. They may only meet some of the administrative needs, and they
could place some pedagogical limitations on the courses.</font></span></p>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">Assessment
systems are strong indicators of how seriously course providers value their aims.
One could argue that summative assessment is such an important issue for
students, teachers, and course providers that experimentation with online
assessment functions is risky and hard to find support for. Two obvious
challenges for online assessment are authentication of student identification
and detection of plagiarized digital material. Other barriers are public and
institutional regulations, traditions for physical attendance, and technical
limitations. These barriers to online assessment counteract the development of
online education since they support face-to-face attendance and preserve
traditional education.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While
summative assessment of online courses seems to be very traditional and often
has a face-to-face component, formative assessment is more experimental and
based on online activities.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However,
there are some strategies that could improve online assessment. This author (Paulsen,
1998) has previously suggested that course providers should consider the
following five strategies to organize and improve online assessment:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
      <blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">1.
Consider testing the learners' ability to find and apply information, rather
than to memorize and reproduce it.</span></em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">
One possible approach to online assessment could be to focus more on the
students' knowledge management abilities and less on their knowledge of the
course content as Mason discussed in her book on global education:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
        <blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">...content-based
methods of assessment are still being applied to conditions which demand a
skills-based approach. This is undoubtedly because it is easier to design
reliable assessment systems which test content rather than process. We have much
less experience in assessing students' knowledge management abilities, the ways
in which the course has transformed their thinking, and developed their skills
in communicating and working with colleagues in the domain of the course content
(Mason 1998, 42).<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
        </blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">2.
Consider applying assessment that does not require face-to-face sessions.</span></em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">
It is noteworthy to observe that online assessment is not necessarily viewed as
an important part of courses. But, if online courses rely on assessment in
face-to-face sessions, flexibility for the students is substantially limited.
For example, centralized, face-to-face examinations are not convenient for
students who live far from the examination site. In comparison, assessment based
on project reports and term papers are much more flexible with regard to time
and space.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">3.
Consider including computer assessment.</span></em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">
Computer assessment would suit online courses very well since course providers
and learners have computers at their disposal. Such assessment could include
simple multiple-choice assignments or more complex tutorials that monitor the
students' progress. Further, computer assessment could provide immediate
feedback and reduce teacher workload.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">4.
Consider including peer assessment.</span></em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">
CMC could be very well suited for peer assessment because students easily can
share and comment on contributions. After all, most CMC systems are developed to
facilitate such collaboration. Further, by requiring peer students to take part
in the process, assessment could become an integral part of their learning
experience.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">5.
Consider using group assignments.</span></em><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-US"> Assessment of group assignments is likely to require less teacher
workload than assessment of similar assignments prepared by individual students.
Further, collaboration among online students could increase learning and result
in a product of higher quality.</span></font></p>

The
major concern arising from this author’s thesis research (Paulsen 1998, 186)
was how to keep teacher workload at an acceptable level. Hence, I suggested the
following eight strategies to reduce the workload per student associated with
large-scale enrollment.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
      <blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
 1. <em>Form
a group of experienced and well-trained teachers.</em> The survey shows that the
teachers have relatively little experience in CMC teaching, and one may assume
that the workload may be reduced as teachers are trained and gain more
experience. Courses about CMC teaching and teacher training programs should be
developed and made available for the teachers. The survey revealed that a number
of such courses exist, but as additional research and experience on CMC teaching
become available, more and better courses should be developed. Further, the
literature review and the interviews indicate that the workload is especially
high the first time one teaches a CMC course, and that material developed for
one course could be used again in other courses. A group of teachers could
possibly also benefit from collaboration and exchange of experience and course
material. To facilitate teacher collaboration, the organization could organize
face-to-face seminars and online faculty lounges for their teachers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
 2. <em>Establish
a system for technical and administrative support.</em> Some of the teachers
suggested that support staff or the supporting organization should handle some
functions for the teachers. For example, technical questions could probably be
handled better by the technical support staff, and administrative requests could
probably be answered better and more efficiently by the administrative staff.
Even senior students could be engaged to support new students in order to
relieve teachers from trivial support work.<o:p>
</o:p>

attention from spontaneous interactive teaching to deliberate course design</em>.
Moore (1990, 348) argued that &quot;...preactive teaching is deliberative, a
highly rationale process, interactive teaching is more spontaneous and to some
extent controlled by students' questions, requests, and reactions.&quot; Moore's
argument entails that the interactive workload depends more on the number of
enrolled students than the preactive workload does. Similarly, the interviewees'
advice on how teachers could handle more than 100 students indicates that the
interactive workload could be decreased through careful preactive design and
preparation. The course designers should also carefully consider which teaching
techniques are suitable for the course. So, one possible way to handle high
enrollment is to adapt the large-scale model with more emphasis on course design.<o:p>

special attention to the assessment workload per student when you design course
assignments.</em> The number and form of course assignments are especially
important for the teacher workload. So, the course designers should pay especial
attention to the teacher workload generated by the assignments. The teachers'
assessment workload could be reduced considerably by substituting teacher
assessment with peer-, computer-, or self-assessment. Further, group assignments
could entail less teacher assessment than individual assignments do.<o:p>

 5. <em>Restrict
teacher interaction with individual students and small groups of students.</em>
Since the interactive workloads seem to be high in one-to-one techniques and in
many-to-many techniques with high teacher involvement, high enrollment courses
may have to use less of these interactive techniques even though they are
perceived to have high learner outcome. These results support Bates (1991, 13)
when he stated that the technology does not bring economies of scale unless the
opportunities for interaction for individual students are dramatically curtailed.<o:p>

 6. <em>Encourage
and facilitate interaction among students.</em> Students should be regarded as a
resource for mutual learning. Services, teaching techniques, and assignments
could be designed to encourage and facilitate interaction among students. Former
students could become active alumni and be encouraged to participate in some
interaction.<o:p>

 7. <em>Automate
responses.</em> The teacher could develop a response library of often-used
comments and even present this on a bulletin board for Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ). Further, automatic responses could be designed into a course,
for example as automatic e-mail responses or self-correcting quizzes.<o:p>

 8. <em>Develop
a scheme to handle the demand for expedient responses. </em>Several teachers
comment that the time flexibility and the expected response time influence the
nature of their workload. Therefore, one may argue that relaxing the
requirements for expedient responses and allowing more flexible working hours
could ease some teachers' perception of workload. However, students want
expedient feedback, so co-teaching, shift work, and the use of teaching
assistants may be considered as schemes to share a continuous and increasing
workload among several individual teachers. All teachers should also inform the
students about their online work schedule, so that the students know which days
of the week and what time of the day responses from the teachers could be
expected.<o:p>
