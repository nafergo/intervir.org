A short essay I wrote a few years ago, “Ways of Seeing” (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/ways.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/ways.htm</a>), reviews the progression of how humans have developed their ability to record images of three-dimensional objects on flat (two-dimensional) surfaces. Virtual reality (VR) is one of our newer techniques for doing this.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; My first exposure to VR was in 1991 when David Warlick demonstrated Virtus WalkThrough. Dr. Veronica Pantelidis and I were immediately taken by this fascinating computer program. From this modest introduction, Dr. Pantelidis and I considered the impact VR could have on education, and we formed the Virtual Reality and Education Laboratory (VREL), formalizing this interest.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VR is variously defined in the literature, and some of the definitions are quite specific and a few are mutually exclusive. We quickly adopted an operational definition, broad enough to embrace all aspects of VR, yet specific enough to exclude other types of software: <i>Virtual reality is the computer-generated simulation of a real or imagined environment or world.&nbsp; It can be graphics based (e.g., a walkthrough of a building) or text based (e.g., a description of a city where participants can interact with one another).&nbsp;</i></font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; An important quality of VR is immersion or, as it is sometimes described, presence. Immersion is the sense of actually being in the virtual environment as opposed to simply viewing it from the outside. We expect a feeling of immersion when we see a virtual world while wearing a head-mounted display unit. Intuitively, we expect to feel less immersion when viewing a virtual world on the flat screen of a desktop computer. Certainly, the quality (perhaps equated to realism) of the images and the rapidity of displayed changes can affect the feeling of immersion. However, we have noticed that full, focused attention on a virtual model being displayed on a flat-screen can create feelings of complete immersion.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had one student who insisted that the quality of immersion should be the only criterion for defining VR, and he went on to insist that reading is a form of virtual reality. When we pointed out computer simulation as a necessary criterion, he still saw only the quality of presence, often engendered by reading. By requiring computer simulation as a necessary condition for VR, many other instances of presence are excluded, including stage plays, movies, and radio programs as well as reading.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VR is a form of simulation, and simulations are used in many situations. For example, the model of “The Model of San Francisco Bay &amp; The Delta” (<a href="http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/bmvc/model.htm">http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/bmvc/model.htm</a>), allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to simulate a variety of water-flow and flood conditions without affecting the bay itself. Flight simulators introduce pilots to particular airplanes and allow them to gain realistic experience with these planes without endangering themselves or the planes.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific visualization is broadly defined as using various means to visualize scientific phenomena, objects, and relationships. Scientific visualization permits us the opportunity to look and closely examine objects that cannot otherwise be viewed because of their size and/or location. A subset is 3-D visualization in which the x, y, and z axes in a Cartesian grid are represented. Three-dimensionality may be represented with perspective drawings and still- and motion-pictures. Shutter glasses and glasses with anaglyphic or Polaroid lenses may be used to enhance the 3-D effect.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quickly sensed that virtual reality is a powerful instructional tool, one worthy of being added to the successful teacher’s toolbox of instructional tools and methods. To facilitate working with VR in this context and to provide a platform on which to work with VR and to present VR, we formed VREL, a primary purpose of which is to explore the use of virtual reality in the educational process.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “North Carolina Standard Course of Study,” (<a href="http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/curriculum/">http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/curriculum/</a>) developed by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction includes competency-based curriculum objectives for all subjects taught in our state’s public schools. (Most other state have parallel standard courses of study.) Various instructional tools can be used to meet these objectives. Dr. Pantelidis examined the objectives for communication skills, science, and social science (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrits/2-2Pante.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrits/2-2Pante.htm</a>) and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>mathematics (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrits/2-3Pante.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrits/2-3Pante.htm</a>) and identified ways that VR could be used for many of them. I’ve begun some similar work on identifying ways that VR could be used in the arts: theater, dance, art, and music.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using VR as an instructional tool, should the students create their own virtual environments, or should they use ready-made environments? There is no single or correct answer, for the nature of the lesson and the abilities of the students will direct the teacher to use one or the other or both. At times, the instructor will use a ready-made environment to illustrate a particular point or to present a specific relationship. At other times, the instructor will set guidelines for what should be included, and the students will create their own environments, following these guidelines. However, students may not have the time to make their own virtual environments, so using a ready-made virtual environment will be necessary.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students regularly ask me how virtual reality differs from animation and CAD (Computer Assisted Design).</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font></span></p><UL><ul style="margin-top:0cm" type=disc><li class=MsoNormal style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>Animation uses a series of static, pre-drawn images which, when viewed in rapid succession, impart the illusion of movement due to persistence of vision. The point of view is predetermined. The principal variation is the speed at which the images are viewed.</font></span></li></ul><ul style="margin-top:0cm" type=disc><li class=MsoNormal style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>CAD produces static images of 3-D objects.

There is no computer interaction other than changes in the point of view, accomplished by zooming in and out and panning right, left, up, and down.</font></span></li></ul></UL><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual reality embraces a wide spectrum of software and hardware, ranging from quite inexpensive flat-screen VR which can be run on a desk-top or lap-top computer to quite expensive installations that run on mainframe and hefty mini-computers. The peripheral equipment is equally varied, too. For some, only the mouse on a desktop computer is needed. Off-the-shelf shutter glasses and head-mounted display units may cost as little as a few hundred dollars. One-of-a-kind prototypes (force-feedback mechanisms, head-mounted display units, and elaborate tracking devices) may cost millions.</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quickly realized that for VR to be used in the classroom, it would have to be accessible both in cost and in ease of use. Most American public schools depend primarily on local and state resources for budgetary support, and schools in wealthier areas tend to be better supported. Yet, even in the best supported schools, purchasing expensive VR software and hardware is unlikely. Thus, VR software would have to be inexpensive, generally costing less than $100, and be able to run on existing desktop computers.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ease of use means that students, even those as low as fourth and fifth grades, can be taught to use the software in fifteen to twenty minutes. This is important, because the purpose of introducing VR is not to teach the VR program but to use the program in conjunction with a particular lesson. The emphasis must remain on the lesson, regardless of the instructional tool(s) used. A point, click, and drag, interface would be the easiest. More complicated software packages, such as those using vector analysis, were ruled out.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also realized that trying to impose VR on teachers in their classrooms from above would be resented and, most likely, unsuccessful. Instead, we recruited interested individual classroom teachers who wanted to work with VR. We assisted them in learning to use the software, selecting appropriate lessons, designing the VR component, presenting the lesson to the students, and evaluating the usefulness of VR in the lesson.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VR software that we selected as best meeting these criteria happened to be Virtus WalkThrough, the program that David Warlick showed us. With educational discounts, the price was in the right range, and it uses a point, click, and drag interface. Virtus Corporation subsequently released WalkThrough Pro, 3-D Website Builder, and Virtus 4.0. Sadly, none of these are on the market any more, because Virtus Corporation became Virtus Entertainment and no longer sells this type of VR software.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several years we have published <i>VR in the Schools</i> (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/pub.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/pub.htm</a>), first as a quarterly newsletter, then as a quarterly journal. <i>VR in the Schools</i> was first printed and distributed in print. Before long we began distributing it <i>via</i> email as well. Then, with the advent of the World Wide Web, we began putting new issues up as Web pages and converted all of the earlier issues. More recently, <i>VR in the Schools</i> is available only over the Internet</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VREL (Virtual Reality and Education Laboratory) exists in East Carolina University’s Department of Librarianship, Educational Technology, and Distance Instruction (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/LTDI/">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/LTDI/</a>.). However, in the minds of many who are not on campus, VREL is a series of Web pages (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrel.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrel.htm</a>).</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Pantelidis and I developed a series of undergraduate- and graduate-level courses on VR (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrclass.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrclass.htm</a>). The undergraduate courses were originally intended to be a minor; however, when presented to one campus committee, a majority of the members couldn’t/wouldn’t accept VR as a subject to be studied in a university. Also, one important member of the committee was angry with the department, because of an issue that had nothing to do with curriculum. Thus, while the courses were approved by one committee, the minor was rejected by another.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graduate courses form a concentration within a master’s degree in instructional technology (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrmaed.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrmaed.htm</a>). The courses are also available as a Certificate in Virtual Reality in Education and Training (<a href="http://www.soe.ecu.edu/LTDI/certificates/vrcert.htm">http://www.soe.ecu.edu/LTDI/certificates/vrcert.htm</a>).</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classes were originally designed for traditional face-to-face presentation before students in a classroom. When a favorite text went out-of-print and we began looking for an alternate title, we realized that better and more up-to-date resources were available on the rapidly growing World Wide Web. Dr. Pantelidis converted most of the courses to an online format, available through the Internet, and I did the same for the remainder. For the last few years, all of our VR classes have been offered only online. While the majority of the students are from this area of the country, we have had students enrolled through the Division of Continuing Studies from Norway, Singapore, and elsewhere.</font></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;</font><font face=Arial size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sustained visit to the VREL Web pages (<a href="http://soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrel.htm">http://soe.ecu.edu/vr/vrel.htm</a>) provides a broad array of materials on the educational applications of virtual reality. I encourage interested persons to make this visit.</font></span><font face=Arial size=3><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></font></td></tr></table><hr width="40%"><p align=center><font color="#000000"><font face=Arial size=2>© </font><b><font face=Arial size=3>Intervir</font></b><font face=Arial size=2> 2001.</font></font></p></body></html>
